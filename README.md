# Movie-Reservation-and-Recommendation-System

Objective:

The project's goal is to develop a movie reservation and recommendation system
that will make reservations for customers easier by giving them valuable information
without any hassle. The system would be helpful in the following ways:

● Making services widely accessible to customers will result in a decrease in the
number of people using the ticket window to buy tickets, which in turn will
save time and reduce business costs.

● Customer satisfaction is increased since it's simple for them to view the
available movies and make bookings in line with them.

● Improve the theater utilization by knowing how many people will attend each
performance, theaters can better allocate their resources.

● A movie reservation system can offer valuable information about a customer's
movie-watching preferences, which can be utilized to enhance the experience
as a whole.

Scope:

The system should be able to handle the following:

● Users should be able to search for movies by title, genre, or actor/actress.

● Users should be able to view movie showtimes in their cities and purchase
tickets.

● The system should keep track of tickets sold and available seats.

● The system will keep track of movie gross income in the region.

● Users should be able to rate movies they have seen.

● The system should be able to recommend similar movies to users based on
their ratings.
